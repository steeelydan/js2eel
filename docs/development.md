# Development

## Requirements

-   `Node.js` 18 and higher
-   Terminal emulator
    -   Linux, MacOS: `bash` or `zsh`
    -   Windows: `git bash` (comes with `git`)
-   `Reaper` DAW, obviously

## Setup

-   Install dependencies for all packages: `npm ci`
-   Open a different terminal session for each of the following steps
    -   Go to `compiler` and do `npm run dev`
    -   Go to `gui` and do `npm run dev`
    -   Go to `desktop` and do `npm run dev`. Now, the electron build should open.

## Guidelines

-   We aim for 100% test coverage for the compiler package
